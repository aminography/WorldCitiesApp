# Android app architecture in a cleanÂ way

This example project demonstrates a clean way to architect an Android application.
Further details will be explained in a [Medium Post](https://medium.com/@aminography/android-app-architecture-in-a-clean-way-91e8b86e4b6f).

This app consists of three screens with a simple flow of UI:
- A filterable list of world cities
- Viewing a city on map
- Exploring github users of the city

<br/>

#### :warning: **DISCLAIMER:**

In case of large-scale project, for example containing dozens of features, the exact architecture of this project might not be efficient.
It would be better to apply `Clean Architecture` to each feature independently, which leads to higher levels of cohesion and shorter compile-time.

Main Characteristics
--------------------
- Layered architecture => `Clean Architecture`
- Separation of concerns (`SoC`) => `Gradle` modularization
- Lifecycle-aware presentation architecture => `MVVM` pattern
- Single `Activity` pattern => `Jetpack Navigation Component`
- Feature independence => `Dynamic Feature Module`
- Dependency injection => `Dagger2`
- Concurrent programming => `Coroutines`
- Reactive programming => `Flow` and `LiveData`
- Indexing large amount of records (~210k) for retrieving in few milliseconds => `RadixTree`
- Pagination => `Paging3`

Architecture Overview
---------------------
The architecture of the app follows the well-known `Clean Architecture` guidelines to make the business rules as separated as possible.
It consists of 3 main layers: `Data`, `Domain`, and `Presentation` that will be explained in the following.

<br/>

##  Gradle Modules
The overall structure of the codebase is organized into 3 categories of gradle modules.

- `architecture`: modules that establish the `Clean Architecture` layers.
- `common`: modules that provide common components and foundations for `architecture` modules.
- `features`: modules that implement separate features of the application.

Regardless of two test-related modules (*i.e.* `sharedTest` and `sharedAndroidTest`), there are 11 gradle modules. (4 pure `Kotlin` and 7 `Android` module)

Each module follows single responsibility principle, results in higher cohesion.
In addition, modules are decoupled, so they know only each other's interface, which increases their maintainability and testability.

##  Architecture Layers
The overall architecture is organized into 3 main layers:

<br/>

### 1. Presentation
The presentation layer contains the `app` and features, which are all `Android` application modules.
It presents user interface by navigating between different features provided by feature modules.
Features are implemented in `Dynamic Feature Modules` and they will be delivered at install time.
It allows us to separate their code and resources from the base `app` module.
In fact, the `app` module aggregates architectural modules for the features, in addition holds base and navigation-related classes.

### 2. Domain
The domain layer contains business rules and entities, which are pure `Kotlin` modules.
The `domain` module provides the business logic via use-case classes and defines abstraction of repositories to be implemented by the `data` module.
In addition, each use-case object can act as a bridge between `app` and `data` modules.
So, this is the only possible way for the `app` and it descendant features to collaborate with the `data` module.

### 3. Data
As the aim of the data layer is to deal with local or remote sources of data, it needs to interact with the framework.
Therefor, it is an `Android` library module.
The concrete objects are created and delivered to the `domain` by the `dagger`.
It is worth noting that all of the concrete classes in this module are `internal`, so they cannot be exposed to dependant modules, like the `app`.

- The only reason for having a dependency between `app` and `data` is accessing to dagger modules and components located in the `data`, which is required for building the dependency graph by the dagger.

<br/>

## Module Dependencies
The diagram below shows the dependency graph of gradle modules.

Dependency Injection
--------------------
`dagger2` is a powerful tool to establish Inversion of control (`IoC`) in the architecture design.
Using scopes, we can manage the lifetime of objects provided by dagger components.
In this project, scopes are categorized into 3 levels:

- **App-level** scope (*i.e.* `AppScope`) is used for the objects whose lifetime is equal to the app.
So, they are instantiated once and used through whole app, like the `applicationContext`.

- **Foundation-level** scopes define the lifetime of the foundational objects, like the `Retrofit` object.
They can live as long as the app lives or shorter than that.

- **Feature-level** scope (*i.e.* `FeatureScope`) is used for specifying the lifetime of object that should live as long as a feature lives.
